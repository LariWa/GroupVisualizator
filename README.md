# Visualization of the skill levels of individuals to help form groups
This was a one week project as part of the course Information Visualization at KTH in January 2022. I worked together with Fatemeh Bakhshoudeh and Andrea Maderthaner. The website visualizes a dataset of the skills of the students in the course. Using d3.js we created a Zoomable Treemap to visualize the skills of the students. The skills of individuals can be compared and groups with the same skill level can be formed easier.
